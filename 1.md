# Genesys Embeddable Framework → Dynamics 365 Email Integration

This document describes the data flow and core architecture of the integration between Genesys Cloud's Embeddable Framework and Microsoft Dynamics 365. The integration is implemented using an iframe inside Dynamics and uses an AWS Lambda proxy for secure email attachment retrieval.

## Overview

- **Genesys Embeddable Framework** is embedded into **Dynamics 365** as an iframe.
- When a new **email interaction** arrives in Genesys, it triggers the data flow.
- The email and its metadata (participants, subject, body, etc.) are transferred to **Dynamics CRM**.
- Email attachments are downloaded through a secure **AWS Lambda proxy**, base64 encoded, and added to the Dynamics email record.
- Upon successful creation, the email form is opened in Dynamics UI.

## Description of Key Steps

### 1. Initialization

- `handleInitialSetup` loads the PureCloud API and Microsoft CIF.
- Subscribes to email interactions using Genesys' `PureCloud.subscribe`.

### 2. Email Processing

- For each incoming **inbound email**:
  - Converts metadata (sender, recipients, subject, body, time) into Dynamics format.
  - Creates a new `email` record in Dynamics using `Microsoft.CIFramework.createRecord`.
  - Updates status with `Microsoft.CIFramework.updateRecord`.
  - Opens the form with `Microsoft.CIFramework.openForm`.

### 3. Attachment Handling

- Each attachment’s `contentUri` is securely proxied through an **AWS Lambda**.
- The Lambda follows redirects, fetches the file, and returns it as base64.
- The frontend converts and uploads it to Dynamics as `activitymimeattachment`.

### 4. **✅ FedRAMP compliance focus:**

* Hosted in AWS **GovCloud**, not standard AWS.
* No logging of file content or metadata.
* No access to external third-party services.
* Pure function: accepts URL, returns base64 blob.
* 📍 **Always operates inside FedRAMP environment.**

## ✅ FedRAMP Assurance Summary

| Component                         | FedRAMP-Approved? | Notes                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Genesys Cloud CX (iframe SDK)** | ✅                 | Hosted and accessed via FedRAMP-authorized endpoints               |
| **Microsoft Dynamics 365 GCC**    | ✅                 | Dynamics instance runs in U.S. Government cloud (GCC)              |
| **AWS Lambda (GovCloud)**         | ✅                 | Custom proxy runs exclusively in AWS GovCloud with limited scope   |
| **Communication over HTTPS**      | ✅                 | No plaintext transmission; all services use secure TLS connections |
| **No Third-Party Calls**          | ✅                 | All code paths stay inside the authorized environment              |
| **No Persistent Storage**         | ✅                 | The proxy returns binary responses; no logging or external storage |

## 🔐 Security & Isolation Highlights

* 🔐 **No outbound traffic to non-FedRAMP environments**.
* 🧩 Genesys and Dynamics integration is entirely **browser-contained** and operates within two FedRAMP-cleared environments.
* 🛡️ AWS proxy is used strictly for secure file delivery via base64 — no analytics, storage, or external API usage.
* 📜 All code respects FedRAMP logging and data handling practices (no unauthorized persistence or leakage).
* 🚫 **No dynamic script loading from external or third-party domains** — all resources are embedded and static.

---

## ❌ What’s *Not* Happening (FedRAMP Boundaries Maintained)

* No request goes to public APIs or CDN services outside FedRAMP.
* No storage of emails or attachments in intermediate locations.
* No analytics or telemetry beyond basic logging inside approved regions.
* No frontend code injects or modifies external scripts at runtime.
* No access to non-FedRAMP data, environments, or identities.

### 5. Final Steps

- If everything succeeds, the email is shown in Dynamics.
- If it fails, Genesys reroutes the interaction to a fallback queue.

## Technologies Used

- **Genesys Embeddable Framework (PureCloud API)**
- **Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM JavaScript API (CIFramework)**
- **AWS Lambda (Node.js Proxy Function)**
